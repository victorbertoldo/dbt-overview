# Demonstration of a dbt environment
This demo, was built to run inside of `Gitpod`

So, first things first create your own account

## First install the dependencies

With everything done, open a workspace and install all dependencies in the file `requirements.txt`

After that we have to simulate a AWS environment to use a kind of s3 bucket

So run this command to initiate the local AWS:
``` shell
localstack start
```
